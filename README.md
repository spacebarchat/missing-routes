# Spacebar Missing Routes

[![Generate missing routes](https://github.com/spacebarchat/missing-routes/actions/workflows/generate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spacebarchat/missing-routes/actions/workflows/generate.yml)

Generates a list of routes that Spacebar does not implement. Detection may be wonky, but gives a good rough view of things.
Does not account for methods on each route (POST, GET, etc).
